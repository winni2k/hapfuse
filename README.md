# hapfuse

This is my own fork of the SNPTools::hapfuse tool in [SNPTools v1.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/snptools).

## Differences to SNPTools::hapfuse

* **Dependency on htslib for parsing input chunks**.
  This allows me to avoid nasty buffer overruns when input VCFs contain too many samples. Also allows for the use of BCF files.

* **Input VCFs must contain the GT, and APP or GP field**.
  APP stands for phred-scaled allelic probability.  SNPTools uses the AP field, which stands for allelic probability.

* **Input VCFs can have fields with arbitrary precision**.  SNPTools::hapfuse uses the AP field with fixed precision floats while hapfuse v0.4 accepts APP and GP fields of arbitrary precision.  

* **Speed and Reliability**.
  Hapfuse is now way faster than SNPTools::hapfuse as it uses htslib for VCF/BCF parsing.  Hapfuse also concurrently loads, fuses and writes chunks, so expect to see CPU usage at about %200.

* **Regression Tests**. Hapfuse comes with regression tests to make sure it works!

* **Concurrency**. Hapfuse now uses concurrency to simultaneously load, merge and write VCF/BCF files.  This gives about a 2 fold speedup.

## WARNING
Hapfuse does not work with data generated by SNPTools::impute.  This
is because I do not use the AP field and am too lazy to implement
support for it.  Patches welcome.

## Usage

Fusing three bcf files together and save as gzip compressed bcf

    hapfuse file1.bcf file2.bcf file3.bcf -Ob -o fused.bcf.gz

Fusing three WTCCC style hap/sample file pairs together (see
https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/shapeit/shapeit.html#hapsample)
and saving as gzip compressed BCF

    cat hap.files
    file1.hap.gz
    file2.hap.gz
    file3.hap.gz

    cat sample.files
    file1.sample
    file2.sample
    file3.sample

    hapfuse -h hap.files -H sample.files -Ob -o fused.bcf.gz
